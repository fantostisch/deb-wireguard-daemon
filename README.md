# WireGuard_Surf
#### It is not ready yet!  I haven’t implemented the configuration of the DNS’s, Authentication etc.

#### This project has been tested on Ubuntu! As well as make sure UDP port 51820 is open

## SETTIN UP SERVER
### How to:
### On a Ubuntu server:
`sudo -s`

`apt-get update`

`apt-get upgrade`

### Installing latest Go tools:
`wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.14.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz`

`tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.14.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz'

'rm go1.14.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz` 

### Set-up Go global variables
Edit .bashrc 

`nano ~/.bashrc`

Add those lines, at the bottom of the file: 

`#Go`

`export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin`

`export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin`

Save and exit.

`source ~/.bashrc`

Test if go is successfully installed by executing:

'go version'

### Getting WireGuard
`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wireguard/wireguard`

`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get install wireguard`

Test if WireGuard is successfully installed.

`wg version`

### Clone WireGuard_Surf
`git clone https://github.com/Smolkar/WireGuard_Surf.git`

### Navigate to the project folder and install dependencies
`cd WireGuard_Surf`

`go get`

### Building and running 

` go build`

` ./WireGuard_Surf`

And you can stop it: ctrl+c

### Set up NAT (manually, as much as i would want to do that automatically for conveninence it is not working yet )

!!! "ens3" is my primary network interface. Make sure you modify it with your primary network name ( you can check this by typing the command - `ifconfig` - the first result is your interface. !!!

`iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.0/8 -o ens3 -j MASQUERADE`

Write down server pubic key. Or you can check it up later in “conf” file in the main folder.

## On your PC/MAC:
### Download WireGuard Client
MAC —-> https://apps.apple.com/bg/app/wireguard/id1451685025?mt=12 

Windows ——>https://www.wireguard.com/install/

In the client create a new empty tunnel with the following script. 

`[Interface]`

`PrivateKey = xxxxxxxxxxxxxx=`

`Address = 10.0.0.2/32`

`DNS = 8.8.8.8`

`[Peer]`

`PublicKey = <server_public_key>`

`AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0`

`Endpoint = <server_ip>:51820`

#### Save your client public key. And close the tunnel configuration dialog.


Now when everything is done- open the config file on the server and edit it by adding the first user(you). I am providing the format of the configuration file. The first two parameters are the SERVER PRIVATE AND PUBLIC KEY so don't change that, except if you want to use different once. You just need to add the "public_key" (which can be found benaeth "name" and "private_key") which you have saved previously from the client. Also, you can keep "private_key" of the client empty. 

`{`
 `"PrivateKey": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx=",`
 
 `"PublicKey": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx=",`
 
 `"Users": {`
 
 `"anonymous": {`
   
   `"Name": "anonymous",`
   
   `"Clients": {`
   
   `"1": {`
   
   `"name": "Some_name",`
   
   `"private_key": "",`
   
   `"public_key": "xxxxxxxxxxx=",`
   
   `"ip": "10.0.0.2",`
   
   `"created": "2020-05-26T18:40:59Z",`
   
   `"modified": "2020-05-26T18:40:59Z",`
   
   `"info": ""`
   
   `}`
   
   `}`
   
   
   `}`
  
  
  `}`
 
 `}`
 
 
 Save the configuration and exit. Run the application: 
 
 `./WireGaurd_Surf`
 
 ### Set up NAT (manually, as much as i would want to do that automatically for conveninence it is not working yet )

!!! "ens3" is my primary network interface. Make sure you modify it with your primary network name ( you can check this by typing the command - `ifconfig` - the first result is your interface. !!!

`iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.0/8 -o ens3 -j MASQUERADE`

Write down server pubic key. Or you can check it up later in “conf” file in the main folder.

Activate your tunnel from the application on your PC.

# And you are connected!

I have commented in the source code the endpoints for getting clients or creating such because they don’t work properly……yet.

## List of API endpoints:D
Method    URI    

[GET]     10.0.0.1/identify

[GET]     10.0.0.1/WG/API/anonymous/clients - Lists all of the clients of the user.

[GET]     10.0.0.1/WG/API/anonymous/clients/1 - Shows the first client of the user. ("1" is the id of the client)
